There was an old folktale that elfs in the forest of mystery can make people's wishes all come true. One day, a lost child stepped into this forest and met one of the elfs. The elf asked him why you came here. "Do you have any wishes to fufil? my little friend." 
"How many wishes can I have?" the child asked. "Only one." the elf replied. After a while, the child said "then my only wish is to get another three wishes!".
The elf said "Get your head out of the clouds!!" and end like the story of The Honest Woodcutter. The elf disappeared immediately and never show up again.
